Installing Phobos {#phobos_installation}
===================

Phobos is an Add-On for Blender which simplifies editing robot models and environments to be used in the MARS simulation. Phobos can also be used to visually create urdf files for ROS. This document aims to provide an instruction to set up blender and install the phobos Add-On.

## Linux
The simplest way to install blender in a linux environment is to use your favourite package manager to install blender. In Ubuntu for example just type `apt-get install blender` into a terminal with root permissions. If you want to use the newest and feature richest version of blender you can download a tarball from the [Blender download page](http://www.blender.org/download/). Extract this archive and place it where you want blender to be installed. Please notice that you have to have *glibc* installed on your system to run blender properly!

To install phobos you have to clone the phobos git repository hosted on Github. For that you have to have [git](http://git-scm.com/) installed. Then just type `git clone https://github.com/rock-simulation/phobos.git` into your terminal and switch into the newly created directory named *phobos*. The final step is to run the shell script *install_phobos.sh* and follow the instructions on your terminal window.
At this point it is really important to have [python3](https://www.python.org/) and the python module [yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) installed on your machine. For that purpose most of the major distributions offer packages for yaml (in Ubuntu for example the package is named `python3-yaml`). You can also use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install yaml into your python environment. After this you have a fresh blender installation with the phobos plugin installed!

###Troubleshooting
####If you started the install script before yaml was installed...
Go to `~/.config/blender/BLENDERVERSION/scripts/addons/phobos/` and delete the file `yamlpath.conf`. Then you can re-run the install script and everything will be fine.
